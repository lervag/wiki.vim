INTRODUCTION                                                       *wiki-intro*

This is a Vim plugin for writing and maintaining a personal wiki, also known
as a personal knowledge base. Please see |wiki-intro-usage| for a simple
quick-start guide. See also |wiki-intro-guide| for more in-depth info on what
this is and how one could use such a system efficiently.

`wiki.vim` is a "filetype agnostic" plugin that is intended to work well across
different filetypes. The core functionality is to handle links of various
kinds and to allow workflows to quickly traverse a wiki and to create new
links and new pages. The "filetype agnostic" description is only half true,
because the different link syntaxes are usually tied to a specific
filetype/file format. Also, features like |WikiTocGenerate| depends on
assumptions of an underlying file format. However, it is a core idea that
`wiki.vim` should work well for any text based wiki.

An important point: `wiki.vim` is `not` a filetype plugin! It is designed so
that it may be used along with dedicated filetype plugins, such as dedicated
Markdown plugins.

The plugin will activate by default for Markdown files (`*.md`). This may be
customized with |g:wiki_filetypes| and |g:wiki_global_load|. One may also
explicitly activate with |WikiEnable|. The wiki root is automatically detected
as long as there is a top-level index file available, e.g. `index.md`. The
index name may be changed with |g:wiki_index_name|. If no index file is found,
the root is set to the same directory as the current file. In addition, one
may specify a "main wiki" with the |g:wiki_root| option. This allows
convenient mappings and commands for opening this main wiki from anywhere.

                                                  *wiki-filetype-specification*
`wiki.vim` uses the filename extension to specify a filetype. Notice that
a file extension is not always named the same as the corresponding 'filetype'
option value. For example, the common extension for Markdown is `.md`, whereas
the corresponding 'filetype' is `markdown`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS                                          *wiki-intro-requirements*

`wiki.vim` requires Vim 9.1 or Neovim 0.9.5.

This plugin is mainly developed on and for Linux. Some or most of the features
should still work on Windows and OSX, but currently there are no guarantees.
On Windows, it is assumed that users enable 'shellslash' to avoid issues with
backslashes versus forward slashes.

The following is a list of external tools that are used for some of the
features:

  Program     Feature ~
  =======     =======
  `fzf`         A backend for UI selection (|g:wiki_select_method|)
  `pandoc`      |WikiExport|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE                                                        *wiki-intro-usage*

This outlines the basic steps to get started:

1. Create a wiki directory where the wiki files should be stored, for instance
   `~/wiki`.

2. Add the corresponding option to your `vimrc` file: >vim

     let g:wiki_root = '~/wiki'

3. Now you can open the index file with `<leader>ww` and start to add your
   notes as desired.

The mappings are listed in |wiki-mappings-default|. The most essential
mappings that most users will want to learn are:

- `<cr>` (normal mode): Either follow the link under the cursor, or create
  a link from the text under the cursor.
- `<cr>` (visual mode): Create a link from the selected text.
- `gl`: An |operator| to create a link from the operated text.
- `<bs>`: After following a link: go back to previous location.
- `<tab>`: Move to next link.
- `<shift-tab>`: Move to previous link.
- `<leader>wd`: Delete current page.
- `<leader>wr`: Rename current page and update all incoming links.

See |wiki-mappings-default| for a full list of default options and info on how
to change them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GUIDE                                                        *wiki-intro-guide*

                                                     LAST UPDATED: 2023-03-01
The following guide is more or less an essay on how I personally use
`wiki.vim` for structuring and writing my notes. I take the liberty of writing
in the first tense, as this is clearly a subjective matter. An initial version
of this was posted as a comment in an issue thread [0] (note: the links are
listed at the bottom). I recommend anyone interested to read the entire thread
(although it is quite long!).

I've structured the following guide in two main sections. The first section
concerns how to keep a personal wiki or knowledge base. In the second,
I explain how I keep my daily journal. But first, a quote that I think
captures the most important concept in a single sentence (by @mgoral [1]):

> I think that the most important thing is to not overthink things and just
> keep writing stuff down.

Executive summary ~
- Speed is key - make sure you have a fast workflow:
  - Use a keyboard shortcut in your desktop/window manager to open Vim/neovim
    with the wiki index (e.g. <alt-n>).
  - Use something like |:WikiPages| and `ripgrep` (with e.g.
    `ctrlsf.vim` [2]) for searching.
- Write short pages and use links between related pages.
- Don't obsess about the wiki structure.

A personal wiki ~
People write things down. Take notes. Why? Because people, or at least most of
us, don't remember things for too long. From my point of view, taking notes
is a way to extend my memory. And writing the notes is itself a useful
process, because it often helps both to learn and to remember things.

I find the idea of keeping my notes linked and easily searchable in pure text
to be extremely potent. With `wiki.vim`, I can very quickly locate relevant
notes for a topic. I believe strongly that speed or efficiency is the key
aspect of a good personal-knowledge system. However, before I continue, I want
to stress that `wiki.vim` is just one such system. There are probably
countless, and I encourage everyone to find a system that works for them. Some
alternatives are listed under |wiki-intro-alternatives|.

So, some context: My personal wiki consists per 2023-03-01 of 2728 pages with
a total of 96969 lines (excluding my journal). I first started taking notes in
2007, so this is perhaps 16 years' worth of writing. I use Syncthing [3] to
keep my notes synchronized across my computers, phones, and tablets. I've
previously also used Dropbox.

Needless to say, it is important to be able to find relevant notes fast.
I have a global Vim mapping `<leader>ow` to open a page search interface.
I previously used |:WikiPages|, which works very well! Today, though, I use
Telescope [4] with a personal function to list wiki files [5]. It usually
takes no more than a couple of seconds from the moment I think of something
until I have opened the relevant note. A key here is to use simple names for
the pages. I prefer several short pages instead of one long, if possible.
I also don't worry about using spaces in my wiki file names.

Sometimes I search for things within pages. For this, I rely on `ripgrep` [6].
I use `ctrlsf.vim` [2] (which uses `ripgrep` as a backend). I map this to
`<leader>ff`. This makes it very easy and fast to search the wiki. And if my
search has too many hits, I can either narrow it down by changing the search
pattern, or I can search within the result buffer of `ctrlsf.vim`. This has
generally not failed me in finding information I'm looking for. I don't spend
a lot of time searching for things. If I know I've written about something,
I always find it with `<leader>ow` and/or `<leader>ff`, and usually in
a matter of seconds.

How do I write my notes? I make sure to write down what I feel like at the
moment. I then clean it up and rinse/repeat as something is developing. I add
links to relevant external and internal pages/resources. I often add examples,
for instance tools I discover or libraries I learn about.

With time, I've started to adopt an unstructured approach where I avoid
complicated structure and subdirectories. I try to use the proper names of
things as the name of a page. The simple structure makes it easy to convert
text to the correct links and it makes it easy to remember the relevant page
names.

I don't worry about having many pages. I don't worry about almost empty pages.
I don't worry about keeping my pages in a hierarchy. I've found it can be
useful to split information into separate pages, as it makes it easier to link
things. I sometimes find the graph features useful, e.g. |wiki-graph-in|, but
I don't use them much.

However, sometimes I write down stuff that I don't know where to put. This is
where I use my index (`index.wiki`). This file is where I put anything that
does not currently have a home. I may also use it to link to pages that need
attention. For example, if I were to notice that my wiki page about Topic X is
outdated and/or needs some work, then I add a link to it from my index. With
time, I work through the index (often slowly) and move content into more
dedicated pages. For this workflow to work well, it is crucial that my index
is extremely accessible. I therefore have a global keyboard shortcut on all my
computers to open the index in neovim in new terminal. Specifically, I map
<alt-n> to the shell command `urxvt -e nvim +WikiIndex`, where `urxvt` is
a well-known terminal. This way, it takes less than a second from the moment
I have a thought until I can start to add it to my `index.wiki` for later
processing. The speed allows me to write down a thought immediately and then
continue with the current work without being severely disrupted - this is what
makes the concept so important.

Although I do add a lot of text to my wiki, I've also realized that I should
not add all data there. For instance, I've come to use Zotero [7] for managing
my literature database. This is also why there is now some support for Zotero
within `wiki.vim` (see |wiki-link-cite|).

For some topics, I may write a wiki page about stuff where I have links to
data files in which I can append new data and to scripts I can run to
visualize the data. Thus, I don't keep everything in the wiki, instead, I may
write the "metadata" and general overview in the wiki, and then keep the real
data and relevant tools as a "third party".

Daily journal ~

I keep a daily journal. I use |:WikiJournal| to open today's page. For each
day, I tend to write a short memo on what I did that day. I've found it
convenient to format this as lists for each main topic/project/activity. This
makes it easier to write weekly and monthly summaries.

I use |WikiJournalToWeek| and |WikiJournalToMonth| commands to create the
summaries. I write them in retrospective. I use another plugin of mine,
lists.vim [8], which has a command `ListsUniq` that I use to quickly write
and combine these summaries.

I reserve my journal for work-related activities. This includes minutes of
meetings or notes from events and courses. However, I don't use my journal to
log mundane tasks or other temporal acitivities. Instead, I keep a log of such
things in a related wiki page. For instance, I have a wiki page for my house
where I keep a log of repairs and similar.

I usually plan my work week each Monday by manually writing and maintaining
TODOs for each day in the week. I also have an entry for the next Monday where
I put TODOs that are not for the present week.

This way, my journal serves as a task tracker where I write quick comments
about tasks when I work on them. I generally avoid adding "real" information
content to my journal. a journal entry. Instead, I create links to my main
wiki and put valuable content there. This way, if I work on something, then
work on it again after a long break, the content is readily available when
I get back to it. In some cases, I do link from my wiki to a specific journal
entry - for instance when I refer to meeting notes.

If I'm curious about what I did at a particular date, I use calendar.vim [9]
to find the date and open the corresponding entry (see [10, 11] for my related
Vim configuration). I'm generally never interested in any form of journal
index (|WikiJournalIndex| exists because some users find it useful, though).
The calendar.vim interface is more or less everything I need in that regard.

Similar to my personal wiki index, I use a global shortcut to open today's
journal page: <alt-j>. This is mapped to `urxvt -e nvim +WikiJournal`. I find
it very useful as it makes it very easy to quickly open my daily journal if
I want to make a note or read about something I did earlier.

Over time, the journal entries have a great value in that it is easy to go
back and see what I did at a particular point in time. The summaries make it
easy to get a larger overview. I don't use them often, but when I do, I'm glad
I have them. I also find the process of writing all of these things useful as
it makes me think about what I'm doing - both the planning part and the
retrospective part.

Closing words ~

Finally, I again stress that these are my personal experiences and opinions,
and I very much acknowledge that what works for me probably does not work for
everyone else.

OTHER USEFUL PLUGINS                                       *wiki-intro-plugins*

Some users may find that `wiki.vim` does not provide all of the features they
want for taking notes. Users who are used to Vimwiki will probably miss things
like features to interact with lists and check lists. This is a natural
consequence of the idea to "do one thing and do it well"; the core feature of
`wiki.vim` is to handle links in various formats and shapes. It has additional
wiki features and some fringe features, but these are not as important.

The following is a list of plugins that one may want to use alongside
`wiki.vim` for a more "complete" experience. If a user reads this list and
things that it is lacking, they are very welcome to suggest additions!

Markdown ~
Many users prefer to use `wiki.vim` with the Markdown filetype. Vim and neovim
ship with a decent Markdown plugin by default, but there are also popular and
well maintained alternatives with more features. Here are some popular
options:

- https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown (this is shipped with Vim and neovim)
- https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown
- https://github.com/SidOfc/mkdx/
- https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax

wiki-ft.vim ~
https://github.com/lervag/wiki-ft.vim
`wiki-ft.vim` is a simple filetype plugin for `.wiki` files that provides
syntax highlighting and folding. Recommended settings if you want to use
this: >vim

  let g:wiki_filetypes = ['wiki']

lists.vim ~
https://github.com/lervag/lists.vim
This is a Vim plugin to manage text based lists and check lists.

Tables ~
There are a lot of plugins to work with tables. These are both excellent:
- https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-table-mode
- https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align

calendar.vim ~
https://github.com/itchyny/calendar.vim
A plugin that provides a neat calendar feature. It can be integrated with
`wiki.vim` with e.g. this to map `<cr>` to open the selected date in the
journal or diary in `wiki.vim`: >vim

  augroup init_calendar
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType calendar
          \ nnoremap <silent><buffer> <cr>
          \ :<c-u>call wiki#journal#open()<cr>
  augroup END

link.vim ~
https://github.com/qadzek/link.vim
A plugin for managing long URLs. It converts inline Markdown links to
reference-style links, to keep them out of your way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALTERNATIVES                                          *wiki-intro-alternatives*

There exist a lot of alternatives to `wiki.vim`. Within the Vim ecosystem,
the main alternative is Vimwiki. But there are also a lot of other
alternatives. The following list is probably not very comprehensive. It may be
useful if only as an inspiration to read about alternative approaches. The
descriptions are mostly a copy of the initial text from the relevant home
pages.

Vimwiki ~
https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki
Type: Plugin; Vim
Vimwiki is a personal wiki system for Vim. It relies on its own filetype,
although recent versions also support more traditional Markdown formats.

Fun fact: `wiki.vim` was initially based on Vimwiki, but it is written from
scratch and is based on the philosophy of "do one thing and do it well".

Waikiki ~
https://github.com/fcpg/vim-waikiki
Type: Plugin; Vim
Waikiki is a "fisherman's wiki": it provides a minimal set of features to
navigate pages and create links and pages.

Foam ~
https://foambubble.github.io/foam/
Type: Plugin; Visual Studio Code
Foam is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by Roam
Research, built on Visual Studio Code and GitHub.

Roam Research ~
https://roamresearch.com/
Type: Software
A note-taking tool for networked thought. As easy to use as a document. As
powerful as a graph database. Roam helps you organize your research for the
long haul.

Emacs Org Mode ~
https://orgmode.org/
Type: Plugin; Emacs
A GNU Emacs major mode for convenient plain text markup — and much more. Org
mode is for keeping notes, maintaining to-do lists, planning projects,
authoring documents, computational notebooks, literate programming and more
— in a fast and effective plain text system. Several ports to Vim exist to
varying degrees of completion.

Obsidian.md ~
https://obsidian.md/
Type: Software
"A second brain, for you, forever." Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base on
top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.

==============================================================================
LINKS                                                               *wiki-link*

Links are the most essential concept of a wiki. As such, it is important to
understand them. Simply stated, a link is a "structure" that consists of a URL
and a possibly empty description. URL is short for Uniform Resource Locator
and is an address to a resource.

The URL concept is specified in RFC 3986 "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):
Generic Syntax" (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986). A typical URL
looks like this: `scheme:target-address`. Some examples of URLs:

- `http://www.example.com`
- `wiki:index`
- `journal:2013-04-05`
- `doi:10.1002%2Fandp.19053220607`

It is easy to confuse the concept of the link with that of the URL itself, but
these are two distinct concepts. A URL is by definition a link, but a link may
be "more" than just a URL. Some examples of valid links recognized by
`wiki.vim`: >

  http://www.example.com                     link is just a URL
  <wiki:a wiki link with spaces>             <…> allows URLs with spaces
  [[http://www.example.com]]                 wiki link without description
  [[http://www.example.com|a wiki link]]     wiki link with description
  [a markdown link](http://www.example.com)  markdown link with description

The mappings that act on links are listed in |wiki-mappings-default|. The most
notable default mappings are:
- A link may be followed with `<cr>`.
- `<cr>` used on normal text (not on a link) will transform the text into
  a link of the type specified by |g:wiki_link_creation|. This also works in
  visual mode.
- Similarly, `gl` may be used to turn operated text into a link.
- One may use `<bs>` to navigate back after following a link.
- `<leader>wf` can be used to transform a link between different types (see
  |g:wiki_link_transforms|).

`wiki.vim` is very customizable with respect to how it should behave for
a given link. Consider the following example: >

  [[scheme:target-address|describing text goes here]]

    \______ URL ________/ \_____ description _____/

The `scheme:` part of the URL is important. It is "optional", but only in the
sense that many link types have a default "implied" scheme given by
|g:wiki_link_default_schemes|. The URL scheme is used to select the `resolver`
and `handler` functions used by `wiki.vim` to follow a link. Users can
override the default functions by use of the |g:wiki_link_schemes| option.
This also allows to easily implement custom schemes. See the section
|wiki-advanced-configuration| for examples of how one can do this.

So, in summary: When a user presses `<cr>` to follow a link, `wiki.vim` will
do these things:
- The link is first parsed to detect the URL and possibly prepend a default
  scheme.
- The link URL is then passed to an optional `resolver` function that "parses"
  the raw link.
- The possibly resolved URL is then passed to a `handler` that opens/follows
  the link.

URL SCHEMES                                                  *wiki-link-schemes*

The following is a list of the schemes that are supported out of the box.

wiki ~
  Links to internal wiki pages. The address can be both relative and absolute.
  Absolute addresses are relative to the wiki root. Further, the addresses may
  include anchors to specific sections of the wiki entry. Some examples might
  be enlightening: >

    wiki:index

    If the address has whitespace, we need to use a full link style, for
    instance:

    [[wiki:index#section 1]]

    With default settings, wiki link types also imply the wiki scheme, thus
    the following is equivalent to the latter:

    [[index#section 1]]
<
journal ~
  Links to journal pages. The address should be a date format at a specified
  level/frequency:

    - daily: `YYYY-MM-DD` (standard ISO date)
    - weekly: `YYYY-wWW`
    - monthly: `YYYY-MM`

  Notice that these formats will be translated to the corresponding filename
  formats in the `date_format` key of |g:wiki_journal|. Some examples of
  journal urls: >

    journal:2014-03-02
    journal:2014-w09
    journal:2014-03
<
  For convenience, the ISO date will also be recognized as a journal url
  without the scheme.

  Note: This scheme works well as long as there is only a single page per
        date. If you want to use multiple entries per date you should avoid
        this scheme and you should probably consider to change the
        `use_journal_scheme` option (see |g:wiki_journal_index|).

file ~
  Links to a local file. |g:wiki_viewer| is used by the default handler to
  open a file. It can be useful to define a custom `handler` function for the
  `file:` scheme to specify desired behaviour for different filetypes. As for
  any scheme, users can implement a custom file handler with
  |g:wiki_link_schemes|.

doi ~
  Resolves `doi:ADDRESS` to `http://dx.doi.org/ADDRESS` and uses the `generic`
  scheme handler to open.

zot ~
  This is an early version of a Zotero scheme. It uses `fd`, `fdfind`, or
  `find` (in preferred order) to search the Zotero storage for a matching pdf.
  This works very well if one uses the Zotfile extension and the Better Bibtex
  extension to ensure that all pdf files are named according to the format
  `%b - {%T - } {%t}`, where `%b` is the citekey. Then links like
  `zot:citekey` should result in unique matches. The resulting file is opened
  with |g:wiki_viewer|. The Zotero storage root may be specified with
  |g:wiki_zotero_root|.

  The same link type can also work well for JabRef bibliographies. JabRef does
  not allow to open the database on a specific key. But if your JabRef library
  has PDFs that are named similarly as explained above, then it should suffice
  to point |g:wiki_zotero_root| to your literature folder. Now following
  `zot:citekey` (or the shorthand `@citekey`) will allow to open the PDFs in
  your JabRef bibliography directly.

generic ~
  If the scheme is not otherwise recognized, then the URL is opened with the
  system handler. This is defined by the `_` key of |g:wiki_viewer| on Linux.
  Currently, only Linux is supported here.  This will work quite well on
  standard Linux distributions, e.g. for following `http` and `https` URLs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPPORTED LINK TYPES                                          *wiki-link-types*

These are the currently supported link types:

- Wiki links                             |wiki-link-wiki|
- Markdown links                         |wiki-link-md|
- Markdown image links                   |wiki-link-md_fig|
- Orgmode links                          |wiki-link-org|
- Reference links                        |wiki-link-reference|
                                         |wiki-link-ref_target|
- AsciiDoc cross references              |wiki-link-adoc_xref_bracket|
                                         |wiki-link-adoc_xref_inline|
- AsciiDoc link macro                    |wiki-link-adoc_link|
- Cite links                             |wiki-link-cite|
- ISO dates                              |wiki-link-date|

Wiki links ~
                                                               *wiki-link-wiki*
Wiki links are similar in style to the standard Mediawiki links [0]. A couple
of examples: >

  [[URL]]
  [[URL|Description]]

In `wiki.vim`, the wiki link URL is recognized as any general URL except it
has `wiki` as the default implied scheme.

[0]: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links

Markdown links ~
                                                                 *wiki-link-md*
Markdown links look like this: >

  [Description](URL)

Markdown image links ~
                                                             *wiki-link-md_fig*
Markdown image links are similar to markdown links: >

  ![Caption text](URL)

Orgmode links ~
                                                                *wiki-link-org*
Orgmode links look identical to wiki links if they don't have a description.
If they have a description, it is added within the outer square brackets
within a second pair of square brackers. Examples: >

  [[URL]]
  [[URL][Description]]

Reference links ~
                                                          *wiki-link-reference*
                                                         *wiki-link-ref_target*
Reference style links consist of up to three parts: A `label`, an optional
`description`, and a `link target`. The syntax is best explained through an
example: >

  The most simple form, and perhaps the most useful one, is to add a simple
  reference like this [1].

  One may also add a [description][label].

  The target may consist of both words and numbers, e.g. [like this][Ref 3].

  [1]: <URL 1>
  [label]: <URL 2>
  [Ref 3]: <URL 3>

Reference links are implemented as two different link types:

- `reference`: matches links used in the text, such as `[1]` and
  `[text][label]`. Following this link will either open the target URL or move
  the cursor to the target URL. Notice that this link type does not allow to
  specify a default scheme, because it will use the reference scheme under the
  hood for resolving the proper url.

- `ref_target`: matches link targets, such as `[1]: URL`. Following this will
  open the URL.

Asciidoc cross references ~
                                                  *wiki-link-adoc_xref_bracket*
                                                  *wiki-link-adoc_xref_inline*
AsciiDoc cross-reference links or xrefs [0] look like this: >

  Bracket style
    <<anchor>>
    <<anchor,Description>>
    <<filename.adoc#anchor>>
    <<filename.adoc#anchor,Description>>

  Inline macro
    xref:anchor[Description]
    xref:filename.adoc#anchor[Description]
    xref:[LONG URL][Description]

The `[LONG URL]` variant is supported for cases where the filename contains
spaces.

[0]: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/xref/

Asciidoc link macros ~
                                                          *wiki-link-adoc_link*
The AsciiDoc link macro [0] is a generic link syntax that looks like this: >

  link:<target>[<attrlist>]

The `[<attrlist>]` will be recognized by `wiki.vim` as the link text.

[0]: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/link-macro/

Cite links ~
                                                               *wiki-link-cite*
The cite links are a convenient link type that can be used with e.g. Zotero
URLs. That is, instead of writing a link with URL `zot:citekey` one may simply
write `@citekey`.

See also |wiki-link-schemes| for more info on the Zotero URL scheme and
handler.

Iso dates ~
                                                               *wiki-link-date*
Dates written in ISO date format, e.g. 2023-05-05, will be recognized as
a link to `journal:2023-05-05`.

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                          *wiki-options*

`wiki.vim` has several options to configure the behaviour. The following is
a reference of all available options.

*g:wiki_cache_root*
  Specify the cache directory for `wiki.vim`.

  Default value: OS dependent

    `Linux and MacOS`: `'~/.cache/wiki.vim/'`
    `Windows`:         Standard temporary folder (based on |tempname()|)

*g:wiki_cache_persistent*
  Specify whether to use persistent caching.

  Default value: 1

*g:wiki_completion_enabled*
  Specify whether to override 'omnifunc' when entering a wiki buffer. Set this
  to 0 if you want to use another omnifunc.

  Default value: 1

*g:wiki_completion_case_sensitive*
  Specify whether to use case-sensitive matching for omnicompletion of links
  and tags.

  Default value: 1

*g:wiki_export*
  A dictionary that specifies the default configuration for |WikiExport|
  options. See the specifications for the options for more information.

  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_export = {
          \ 'args' : '',
          \ 'from_format' : 'markdown',
          \ 'ext' : 'pdf',
          \ 'link_ext_replace': v:false,
          \ 'view' : v:false,
          \ 'output': fnamemodify(tempname(), ':h'),
          \}

*g:wiki_filetypes*
  List of filetypes for which `wiki.vim` should be enabled. As explained in
  |wiki-filetype-spec|, the filetypes are specified by the file extension.

  The first element of the list is considered the default filetype where that
  is relevant.

  Default: `['md']`

*g:wiki_fzf_pages_force_create_key*
  Key combination that, when pressed while searching with |WikiPages|, will
  create a new page with the name of the query. The value must be a string
  recognized by fzf's `--expect` argument; see fzf's manual page for a list of
  available keys.

  Default: `'alt-enter'`

*g:wiki_fzf_pages_opts*
  A string with additional user options for |WikiPages|. This can be used
  e.g. to add a previewer. Users should be aware that the page candidates are
  "prettified" with the `--with-nth=1` and `-d` options for fzf, so to obtain
  the page path in a previewer option one must use the field index expression `1`.
  E.g.: >vim

    let g:wiki_fzf_pages_opts = '--preview "cat {1}"'
<
  Default: `''`

*g:wiki_fzf_tags_opts*
  A string with additional user options for |WikiTags|. Similar to
  |g:wiki_fzf_pages_opts|, except one should use the field index expression
  `2..` to obtain the page path. E.g.: >vim

    let g:wiki_fzf_tags_opts = '--preview "bat --color=always {2..}"'
<
  Default: `''`

*g:wiki_fzf_links_opts*
  A string with additional user options for |WikiLinkAdd|. Similar to
  |g:wiki_fzf_pages_opts|.
<
  Default: `''`

*g:wiki_global_load*
  `wiki.vim` is inherently agnostic in that it assumes any recognized filetype
  specifies a wiki. However, some people might want to load `wiki.vim` for
  ONLY files within a globally specified directory |g:wiki_root|. To allow
  this behaviour, one can set this option to 0.

  Default: 1

*g:wiki_select_method*
  A dictionary of functions that allows the user to choose the preferred
  behaviour for |WikiPage|, |WikiTags|, |WikiToc| and |WikiLinkAdd|. This
  gives the user a lot of flexibility to specify how these commands will work.
  See |wiki-advanced-config-3| for an example configuration.

  The following table shows the option keys and the related commands:

    key     command
    ---     -------
    `pages` |WikiPages|
    `tags`  |WikiTags|
    `toc`   |WikiToc|
    `links` |WikiLinkAdd|

  The dictionary values can be one of two types:

    - |String|: The name of a function to be executed;
    - |Funcref|: A function that will be executed.

  The following builtin alternatives can be used:

    - fzf (https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim):
      - `wiki#fzf#pages()`     |g:wiki_fzf_pages_opts|
                             |g:wiki_fzf_pages_force_create_key|
      - `wiki#fzf#tags()`      |g:wiki_fzf_tags_opts|
      - `wiki#fzf#toc()`
      - `wiki#fzf#links()`     |g:wiki_fzf_links_opts|
        - Note: I don't know how to return to insert mode with fzf, so the
          insert mode mapping does not work optimally here. Sorry.
    - Lua backend that uses |vim.ui.select| (neovim only!)
      - `require("wiki.ui_select").pages()`
      - `require("wiki.ui_select").tags()`
      - `require("wiki.ui_select").toc()`
      - `require("wiki.ui_select").links()`
    - Telescope (https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
      - `require("wiki.telescope").pages()
      - `require("wiki.telescope").tags()
      - `require("wiki.telescope").toc()
      - `require("wiki.telescope").links()

  Default (neovim): >lua

    vim.g.wiki_select_method = {
      pages = require("wiki.ui_select").pages,
      tags = require("wiki.ui_select").tags,
      toc = require("wiki.ui_select").toc,
      links = require("wiki.ui_select").links,
    }
<
  Default (Vim): >vim

    let g:wiki_select_method = {
          \ 'pages': function('wiki#fzf#pages'),
          \ 'tags': function('wiki#fzf#tags'),
          \ 'toc': function('wiki#fzf#toc'),
          \ 'links': function('wiki#fzf#links'),
          \}
<

*g:wiki_index_name*
  A string with the index page name for the wiki. The value should not include
  the file extension.

  Default: `'index'`

*g:wiki_journal*
  A dictionary for configuring the journal/diary feature. Available options
  are:

    name ~
      Name of journal. This is used to set the journal root path if the root
      is not also specified explicitly.

    root ~
      The root path of the journal. An empty value means that the journal root
      path is `{wiki root}/{journal name}`. This allows for separate wikis
      with their own separate journals.
        However, if the user prefers a single journal in a different location,
      they may specify the journal root. In this case, all journal links will
      be relative to this specific root path. This also means that the `name`
      option is no longer relevant.
        The root path, if specified, should be an absolute path or something
      resolveable to an absolute path.

    frequency ~
      One of 'daily', 'weekly', or 'monthly'. Specifies the desired
      journalling frequency. This is relevant for e.g. |WikiJournal|.

    date_format ~
      Dictionary of filename formats for the 'daily', 'weekly', and 'monthly'
      frequencies. The formats may contain the following keys:

        %y  year (two digits)
        %Y  year (four digits)
        %m  month (01..12)
        %d  day of month (01..31)
        %V  ISO week number with Monday as first day of week
        %U  week number with Sunday as first day of week
        /   Path delimiter

       The files will be rooted at the journal root.

  The following example specifies to create journal entries in a path
  hierarchy: >vim

    let g:wiki_journal = {
          \ 'date_format': {
          \   'daily' : '%Y/%m/%d',
          \   'weekly' : '%Y/week_%V',
          \   'monthly' : '%Y/%m/summary',
          \ },
          \}
<
  With this setting, the journal files would be structured something like
  this: >

    wiki/journal
    ├── 2021
    │   ├── week_01.wiki
    │   ├── week_02.wiki
    │   └── 04
    │       ├── summary.wiki
    │       ├── 25.wiki
    │       └── 26.wiki
    └── 2022
        └── 06
            ├── 25.wiki
            └── 26.wiki
<
  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_journal = {
          \ 'name': 'journal',
          \ 'root': '',
          \ 'frequency': 'daily',
          \ 'date_format': {
          \   'daily' : '%Y-%m-%d',
          \   'weekly' : '%Y_w%V',
          \   'monthly' : '%Y_m%m',
          \ },
          \}

*g:wiki_journal_index*
  A dictionary for configuring the behaviour of |WikiJournalIndex|. Available
  options are:

    link_text_parser ~
      Specify parser function for the link texts. This is a function
      (|Funcref|) or a |lambda| that takes three arguments and must return the
      desired link text. The arguments are:

        1. The basename of the link target without extension.
        2. The ISO date.
        3. The absolute path to the link target.

      This function gives a lot of flexibility. Here are some examples: >vim

        " Use the file basename
        let g:wiki_journal_index = {
              \ 'link_text_parser': { b, d, p -> b }
              \}

        " Use the isodate. This works well as long as there is only a single
        " journal entry per date.
        let g:wiki_journal_index = {
              \ 'link_text_parser': { b, d, p -> d }
              \}

        " Extract and use first header of the file
        let g:wiki_journal_index = {
              \ 'link_text_parser': { b, d, p -> wiki#toc#get_page_title(p) }
              \}
<
    link_url_parser ~
      Specify parser function for the link urls. This is a function
      (|Funcref|) or a |lambda| that takes three arguments and must return the
      desired link url string. The arguments are the same as for
      `link_text_parser`.

      The default setting uses the `journal:` scheme on link urls (see
      |wiki-link-schemes| for more info). Note that the journal scheme does not
      work well if there are multiple pages per single date!

      Here are some examples of alternative configurations: >vim

        " Use the path from wiki root (this is usually a good alternative to
        " the default journal: scheme)
        let g:wiki_journal_index = {
              \ 'link_url_parser': { b, d, p -> p }
              \}

        " Use relative path from current file (i.e. file where you are making
        " the index)
        let g:wiki_journal_index = {
              \ 'link_url_parser': { b, d, p ->
              \   wiki#paths#relative(p, expand('%:p:h'))
              \ }
              \}
<
  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_journal_index = {
          \ 'link_text_parser': { b, d, p -> d },
          \ 'link_url_parser': { b, d, p -> 'journal:' . d }
          \}

*g:wiki_link_creation*
  A dictionary to configure how links are created from text for a given
  filetype. The keys are filetype extensions (|wiki-filetype-specification|).
  The corresponding value is a dictionary of options. If there is no key for
  the current filetype, then the fallback key `"_"` is used.

  The valid options are:

    link_type ~
      A string that specifies the type of link to create. Possible values:

        `md` (|wiki-link-md|)
          Markdown style links.

        `wiki` (|wiki-link-wiki|)
          Wiki style links.

        `org` (|wiki-link-org|)
          Orgmode style links.

        `adoc_xref_bracket` (|wiki-link-adoc_xref_bracket|)
        `adoc_xref_inline` (|wiki-link-adoc_xref_inline|)
          AsciiDoc cross-reference style links (angled brackets style or
          inline `xref:...` style).

    url_extension ~
      A string that, if not empty, will be appended to the target url.

    url_transform ~
      A |Funcref| for a function used to transform the text to the desired
      URL. This can also be an |anonymous-function|. If it is undefined, the
      the original text will be taken as the URL.
        The function requires a single string argument and should return the
      target URL without any file extension. This is useful e.g. to substitute
      space characters, apply URL encoding, or similar.
        An example may be useful. The following configuration will convert all
      characters to lowercase and substitute each set of one or more spaces
      into a single dash character. >vim

        let g:wiki_link_creation = {
              \ 'md': {
              \   'link_type': 'md',
              \   'url_extension': '.md',

              \     substitute(tolower(x), '\s\+', '-', 'g') },
              \ },
              \}
<
  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_link_creation = {
          \ 'md': {
          \   'link_type': 'md',
          \   'url_extension': '.md',
          \ },
          \ 'org': {

          \   'url_extension': '',
          \ },
          \}

*g:wiki_link_default_schemes*
  A dictionary to configure the default URL scheme for link types, i.e. the
  scheme assumed if the URL does not contain an initial scheme specifier. See
  |wiki-link| for more information about link types and a more proper
  definition of URLs and schemes.

  The keys represent the link type and the values are either strings, in which
  case they specify the default scheme, or dictionaries between filetypes
  (notice |wiki-filetype-specification|) and default schemes.

  Note: Reference-style links are special and do not allow to override the
        scheme. See |wiki-link-reference|.

  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_link_default_schemes = {
          \ 'wiki': { 'wiki': 'wiki', 'adoc': 'adoc' },
          \ 'md': 'wiki',
          \ 'md_fig': 'file',
          \ 'org': 'wiki',
          \ 'adoc_xref_inline': 'adoc',
          \ 'adoc_xref_bracket': 'adoc',
          \ 'adoc_link': 'file',
          \ 'ref_target': '',
          \ 'date': 'journal',
          \ 'cite': 'zot',
          \}

*g:wiki_link_schemes*
  A dictionary to configure how URLs are handled. The keys represent the
  schemes and the values are dictionaries that specify the desired `resolver`
  and `handler` functions:

    resolver ~
      |Funcref|: (URL object) => URL object (OPTIONAL)
      This function parses the URL object and returns a new URL object. This
      is useful to e.g. enrich or change the URL before handing it to the
      `handler`. For example, the `resolver` can be used to apply URL
      encoding or decoding.

    handler ~
      |Funcref|: (URL object, edit_cmd) => NONE (REQUIRED)
      A function that takes a possibly resolved URL object and an `edit_cmd`
      and acts on it. The `edit_cmd` is necessary to implement the various
      commands like |WikiLinkFollow|, |WikiLinkFollowSplit|, and
      |WikiLinkFollowTab|.

  Only the `handler` is required. Both functions has as input a URL object,
  which is a dictionary that initially looks like this (before any `resolver`
  has been applied): >vim

    let l:url = {
          \ 'url': 'URL HERE',
          \ 'scheme': 'SCHEME',
          \ 'stripped': 'URL WITHOUT SCHEME',
          \ 'origin': 'THE ORIGIN FILE'
          \}
<
  IMPORTANT: The `resolver` can return an object with different properties.
  However, the `scheme` attribute is required as it is used to select the
  appropriate `handler`.

  Notice that the `resolver` and `handler` needs to "fit". That is, the
  `handler` may depend on properties of the URL object that are added or
  changed by a corresponding `resolver`. For example, many of the built-in
  resolvers will add a `path` attribute that specifies the full path to
  a file. This is in turn used by the `handler` to open the corresponding
  file.

  Finally, notice that built-in resolvers and handlers are found
  automatically. That is, this option is not the mechanism used internally for
  resolving the relevant function. Instead, this option provides an interface
  to users to allow to easily override the built-in functions and add support
  for new schemes.

  See |wiki-advanced-configuration| for examples of how to add support for
  a new scheme and for how to modify one of the existing schemes.

  Default: `{}`

*g:wiki_link_transform_on_follow*
  This option allows disabling the transform behaviour in |WikiLinkFollow|
  where "normal" text under the cursor is transformed into links. The
  behaviour is enabled by default. If disabled, one may still use
  |WikiLinkTransform| to transform text into links.

  Default: 1

*g:wiki_link_transforms*
  This option specifies the template for transforming a specific type of link
  with |WikiLinkTransform| or |<plug>(wiki-link-transform)|.

  This allows customizing how links are changed when they are transformed. For
  instance, to add/remove extensions for wiki and markdown style links, one
  could use: >vim

    function TransformWikiToMd(url, text, link) abort dict
      return wiki#link#templates#md(
            \ a:url . '.wiki',
            \ empty(a:text) ? a:url : a:text,
            \ a:link)
    endfunction

    function TransformMdToWiki(url, text, link) abort dict
      let l:url = substitute(a:url, '\.wiki$', '', '')
      return wiki#link#templates#wiki(l:url, a:text, a:link)
    endfunction

    let g:wiki_link_transforms = {
          \ 'md': 'TransformMdToWiki',
          \ 'wiki': 'TransformWikiToMd',
          \}
<
  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_link_transforms = {
          \ 'wiki': 'wiki#link#templates#md',
          \ 'md': 'wiki#link#templates#wiki',
          \ 'org': 'wiki#link#templates#org',
          \ 'adoc_xref_bracket': 'wiki#link#templates#adoc_xref_inline',
          \ 'adoc_xref_inline': 'wiki#link#templates#adoc_xref_bracket',
          \ 'date': 'wiki#link#templates#wiki',
          \ 'cite': 'wiki#link#templates#md',
          \ 'url': 'wiki#link#templates#md',
          \}

*g:wiki_mappings_use_defaults*
  Whether or not to use default mappings (see |wiki-mappings-default|). The
  allowed values are:

    - `'all'`     use all default mappings
    - `'local'`   use only buffer-local default mappings
    - `'global'`  use only global default mappings
    - `'none'`    do not use any of the default mappings

  Default: `'all'`

*g:wiki_mappings_global*
*g:wiki_mappings_local*
*g:wiki_mappings_local_journal*
  These options allow one to customize global and buffer local mappings
  through dictionaries where the keys are the right-hand sides and the values
  are the desired left-hand side mappings, e.g.: >vim

    let g:wiki_mappings_global = {
        \ '<plug>(wiki-reload)' : ',wx',
        \}
<
  This example maps `,wx` to |<plug>(wiki-reload)|. The other maps are kept at
  their default (unless |g:wiki_mappings_use_default| specifies otherwise).
  All default mappings are listed in |wiki-mappings-default|.

  Some mappings are defined in other modes than normal mode. In this
  case, one can use the following syntax: >vim

    let g:wiki_mappings_local = {
          \ '<plug>(wiki-export)' : '<c-p>',
          \ 'x_<plug>(wiki-export)' : '<c-p>',
          \}
<
  Here `<c-p>` is mapped to |<plug>(wiki-export)| in normal mode and
  visual mode, respectively. The available `<plug>` mappings are listed in
  |wiki-mappings|.

  For any local mappings that should only be applied in journal entries,
  consider setting |g:wiki_mappings_local_journal|. For example, similar to
  above: >vim

    let g:wiki_mappings_local_journal = {
          \ '<plug>(wiki-journal-prev)' : '[w',
          \ '<plug>(wiki-journal-next)' : ']w',
          \}
<
  Here we create a pair of mappings `[w` and `]w` to navigate between journal
  entries.

  Finally, to disable a map, one may set it to an empty string, e.g.: >vim

    let g:wiki_mappings_local_journal = {
          \ '<plug>(wiki-tag-list)': '',
          \ '<plug>(wiki-tag-search)': '',
          \ '<plug>(wiki-tag-reload)': '',
          \ '<plug>(wiki-tag-rename)': '',
          \}
<
  Default: Undefined

*g:wiki_root*
  Option to specify the wiki root path, i.e. the wiki that is opened with the
  `<leader>ww` mapping. The option value must be a string that is either

    i)   a specific path, or
    ii)  the name of a function that returns a path.

  The latter method allows more flexible determination of the root path, e.g.
  project specific root paths. An example: >vim

    function! WikiRoot()
      let l:local = finddir('wiki', ';./')
      return !empty(l:local) ? l:local : '~/wiki'
    endfunction

    let g:wiki_root = 'WikiRoot'
<
  The `WikiRoot` function first searches for a `wiki` directory in the current
  directory (the one you see with |:pwd|), then upwords until it finds
  a `wiki` directory. If no `wiki` directory is found with |finddir|, the
  function will use `~/wiki` as a fallback.

  Note: The (returned) path must be either a relative or absolute path to an
        existing directory.

  Default: `''`

*g:wiki_toc_filetypes*
  A dictionary to map a filetype extension to a filetype used to parse the TOC.
  The supported filetype formats are currently:

  * markdown
  * asciidoc
  * org

  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_toc_filetypes = {
          \ '_' : 'markdown',
          \ 'md' : 'markdown',
          \ 'adoc' : 'asciidoc',
          \ 'org' : 'org',
          \}

*g:wiki_toc_title*
  The title of TOC listings.

  Default: `'Contents'`

*g:wiki_toc_depth*
  The number of sections to parse for the TOC.

  Default: `6

*g:wiki_tag_list*
  A dictionary that specifies the default options for |WikiTagList|.

  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_tag_list = {
          \ 'output' : 'loclist',
          \}

*g:wiki_tag_search*
  A dictionary that specifies the default options for |WikiTagSearch|.

  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_tag_search = {
          \ 'output' : 'loclist',
          \}

*g:wiki_tag_parsers*
  A list of parsers used to source the tags. The parsers are tried in the
  order they're specified. If a parser matches, then it is selected and used.

  A tag parser is a dictionary object with the following keys:

    match ~
      A function (|FuncRef|) that takes a single argument, the current line.
      It should return |v:true| or 1 if the line contains any tags.

    parse ~
      A function (|FuncRef|) that takes a single argument, the current line.
      It should return a list of the tags in the given line.

    make ~
      A function (|FuncRef|) that takes two arguments: a list of tags, and the
      current line. It should return a new line with the list of tags
      formatted appropriately. This new line will replace the current line.
      This function is used by |WikiTagRename|.

    re_findstart ~
      `OPTIONAL`
      A regular expression (|String|) that should match the start of the
      current tag for tag completion (|wiki-completion|). See
      |g:wiki#tags#default_parser| for an example.

  As an example, one can use the following to parse tags in lines that match
  `tags: keyword1, keyword2` in addition to the default parser: >vim

    let g:wiki_tag_parsers = [
          \ g:wiki#tags#default_parser,
          \ { 'match': {x -> x =~# '^tags: '},
          \   'parse': {x -> split(matchstr(x, '^tags:\zs.*'), '[ ,]\+')},
          \   'make':  {t, x -> 'tags: ' . empty(t) ? '' : join(t, ', ')}}
          \]
<
  See |g:wiki#tags#default_parser| for details on the default tag parser.

  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_tag_parsers = [g:wiki#tags#default_parser]
<
*g:wiki_tag_scan_num_lines*
  A number of lines to read from the top of a page when scanning tags. To scan
  lines from the bottom, use a negative number, e.g. >vim

    let g:wiki_tag_scan_num_lines = -10
<
  To scan the entire files, use: >vim

    let g:wiki_tag_scan_num_lines = 'all'
<
  Default: >vim

    let g:wiki_tag_scan_num_lines = 15

*g:wiki_templates*
  A list of templates for prefilling new pages. Each template should be
  specified as a dictionary with a matcher and a source. Matching may be done
  with regular expressions or with user functions. Similarly, sources can be
  specified as a file source as specified in |wiki-templates-format|, or as
  a user function with a single argument `context` as specified in
  |wiki-templates-context|.

  The possible dictionary keys of a template are:

    match_re ~
      |String|
      A regular expression that will be matched against the new page name.

      Note: The name is not the same as the path and it does not include the
            file name extension. For more advanced matching, you need a custom
            matcher function, i.e. the next key.

    match_func ~
      |Funcref|
      A function that should return |v:true| if the template should be applied
      or |v:false| if it should not apply.

    source_filename ~
      |String|
      The path to a template file. If this is a relative path, then it will be
      relative to whichever path Vim or neovim is currently at when the
      template is executed. If the template file is not found, then the
      template will not be applied and the next template in the list will be
      tried.

    source_func ~
      |Funcref|
      A user function that can use e.g. |append()| to add lines to the file.

  For example: >vim

    function! TemplateFallback(context)
      call append(0, '# ' . a:context.name)
      call append(1, '')
      call append(2, 'Foobar')
    endfunction

    let g:wiki_templates = [
          \ { 'match_re': 'index',
          \   'source_filename': '/home/user/templates/index.md'},
          \ { 'match_re': 'foo',
          \   'source_filename': '.footemplate.md'},
          \ { 'match_func': {x -> v:true},
          \   'source_func': function('TemplateFallback')},
          \]
<
  Notice that in the second template, the `;` is appended to the source
  filename. This means the template file is first searched for in the current
  directory of the new page, then in the parent directory, and so on. If the
  template file is not found, then the next template will be tried.

  Default: `[]`

*g:wiki_template_month_names*
  A list of the names for each month. Used e.g. for interpolating month names
  in the month template, |g:wiki_template_title_month|.

  Default: `['January', 'February', ..., 'December']`

*g:wiki_template_title_month*
  A string that specifies the title of the month template. The following keys
  are interpolated:

    `%(month)`         Month number
    `%(month-name)`    Name of month (see |g:wiki_template_month_names|)
    `%(year)`          Year (4 digits)

  See |wiki-templates-journal-summaries| for more info.

  Default: `'# Summary, %(year) %(month-name)'`

*g:wiki_template_title_week*
  A string that specifies the title of the week template. The following keys
  are interpolated:

    `%(week)`    Week number
    `%(year)`    Year (4 digits)

  See |wiki-templates-journal-summaries| for more info.

  Default: `'# Summary, %(year) week %(week)'`

*g:wiki_ui_method*
  A dictionary that specifies the backend for various input methods. The
  method names are the keys of the dictionary and the backend choices are the
  values.

  The available methods:

    confirm:  Confirm dialogues, e.g. before deleting a pages.
    input:    Input dialogues, e.g. when renaming a page.
    select:   Selection dialogues, e.g. when creating a link from text with
              |<plug>(wiki-link-follow)|, where the text can refer to multiple
              target pages.

  The available backends:

    nvim:     Popup menu created with neovim APIs.
    vim:      Currently there is no Vim-specific implementation. Setting the
              backend to "vim" will currently fallback to "legacy".
    legacy:   Legacy backends that are created by |:echo|ing the menus and
              using |input()| and similar for getting input.

  Default: >vim

    " On neovim
    let g:wiki_ui_method = {
          \ 'confirm': 'nvim',
          \ 'input': 'nvim',
          \ 'select': 'nvim',
          \}

    " Otherwise
    let g:wiki_ui_method = {
          \ 'confirm': 'legacy',
          \ 'input': 'legacy',
          \ 'select': 'legacy',
          \}

*g:wiki_viewer*
  A dictionary that specifies which viewer to use for any given filetype, see
  |wiki-filetype-specification|. The entry `_` specifies the fallback or
  generic viewer. This option thus allows one to setup different viewers for
  different file types that are used by the generic link scheme handler
  (|g:wiki_link_schemes|) and by |WikiExport|.

  The special value `':edit'` indicates to open the file in the current Vim or
  neovim session as with |:edit|.

  Default: OS dependent >vim

    " Common
    let g:wiki_viewer = {
          \ 'md' : ':edit',
          \ 'wiki' : ':edit'
          \}

    " Linux
    let g:wiki_viewer._ = 'xdg-open'

    " MacOS
    let g:wiki_viewer._ = 'open'

*g:wiki_write_on_nav*
  Option to specify whether or not to save the current file automatically
  before navigating (forward or backward) between wiki links.

  Default: 1

*g:wiki_zotero_root*
  A string that specifies the Zotero root folder used for the Zotero URL
  scheme, see |wiki-link-schemes|.

  Default: `'~/.local/zotero'`

==============================================================================
EVENTS                                                            *wiki-events*

Users events can be used by users to add custom behaviour after an event is
triggered. It is probably best explained by a simple example: >vim

  augroup MyWikiAutocmds
    autocmd!
    autocmd User WikiLinkFollowed normal! zz
    autocmd User WikiBufferInitialized
          \ nmap <buffer> gf <plug>(wiki-link-follow)
    autocmd User WikiBufferInitialized WikiLinkIncomingToggle
  augroup END

`wiki.vim` provides the following |User| events:

*WikiBufferInitialized*
  Event is triggered after the buffer features are initialized. This event
  allows one to apply custom mappings and similar.

*WikiLinkFollowed*
  Event is triggered after a link has been followed.

*WikiReloadPost*
  Event is triggered after `wiki.vim` has been reloaded with |WikiReload|.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS AND COMMANDS                                           *wiki-mappings*

Here we describe the mappings and commands provided by `wiki.vim`. We first
list the default mappings, then provide a full reference of all mappings and
commands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFAULT MAPPINGS                                        *wiki-mappings-default*

This is a list of default mappings. Follow the help tags to see more detailed
description of each mapping. The default mappings can be changed with the
following configuration options:

- |g:wiki_mappings_use_defaults|
- |g:wiki_mappings_global|
- |g:wiki_mappings_local|
- |g:wiki_mappings_local_journal|

In the table below, the mode specifier is a single letter which indicates
which mode the mapping is valid in. See e.g. |nmap|, |imap|, |omap| or |xmap|
for more information about the different modes. The lines annotated with
`[GLOBAL]` specify global mappings available anywhere, and the lines annotated
`[JOURNAL]` are only available within the journal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS AND COMMANDS REFERENCE                       *wiki-mappings-reference*

*WikiEnable*
  Load `wiki.vim` for the current file. If the current file type is not in
  |g:wiki_filetypes|, then it will be added, so that interwiki links will be
  possible.

*<plug>(wiki-index)*
*WikiIndex*
  Go to wiki index. When not inside a wiki page, the index is specified by the
  options |g:wiki_root| and |g:wiki_index_name|.

*<plug>(wiki-open)*
*WikiOpen*
`:[range]WikiOpen [page]
  Open (or create) a page. If the `page` argument is not provided, then ask
  for user input to specify the page name. When not already inside a wiki, the
  wiki root is given by |g:wiki_root|.

  The settings from |g:wiki_link_creation| are applied based on the current
  'filetype'. If the filetype is not specified or if it is not listed in
  |g:wiki_filetypes|, then the first filetype in this list is assumed.

*<plug>(wiki-journal)*
*WikiJournal*
  Go to the current journal entry. For the default journal frequency, this
  means today's entry. See also |g:wiki_journal| and the `frequency`
  description.

*<plug>(wiki-reload)*
*WikiReload*
  Reload the wiki plugin. Mostly useful for plugin development.

*<plug>(wiki-graph-find-backlinks)*
*WikiGraphFindBacklinks*
  Find backlinks to current page.

*<plug>(wiki-graph-related)*
*WikiGraphRelated*
  Open a scratch buffer that shows how a page relates to other pages by links
  into (on the left) and out of (on the right).

*<plug>(wiki-graph-check-links)*
*WikiGraphCheckLinks*
  Check the current wiki page for broken links. If any broken links are found,
  they are added to the location list (|location-list|) and the location list
  is opened.

*<plug>(wiki-graph-check-links-g)*
*WikiGraphCheckLinksG*
  Check the entire wiki for broken links. If any broken links are found, they
  are added to the location list (|location-list|) and the location list is
  opened. This can take a while if you have a large wiki.

*<plug>(wiki-graph-check-orphans)*
*WikiGraphCheckOrphans*
  Check the entire wiki for orphaned pages; i.e. pages without any incoming
  links. These pages are added to the location list (|location-list|) and the
  location list is opened.

*<plug>(wiki-graph-in)*
*<plug>(wiki-graph-out)*
*WikiGraphIn*
*WikiGraphOut*
  Show links in to or out of the current page. A count may be given to show
  a specified depth of links. Notice that a large count can take a while if
  you have a large wiki.

*<plug>(wiki-link-add)*
*WikiLinkAdd*
  List the wiki files in the current wiki. Select from the list to add a link
  to that target page. This uses the UI select method defined by
  |g:wiki_select_method|. The mapping also works from insert mode.

*<plug>(wiki-link-next)*
*WikiLinkNext*
  Go to next link.

*<plug>(wiki-link-prev)*
*WikiLinkPrev*
  Go to previous link.

*<plug>(wiki-link-follow)*
*WikiLinkFollow*
  Follow a link. If the text under the cursor is not a link, then it will be
  converted via |WikiLinkTransform|, unless |g:wiki_link_transform_on_follow| is
  disabled.

                                                       *#User#WikiLinkFollowed*
  The user autocommand `WikiLinkFollowed` is triggered after a wiki link has
  been followed. This allows the user to add custom functionality after
  following wiki links. For example, to center the cursor inside the window
  after following a link: >vim

    augroup MyWikiAutocmds
      autocmd!
      autocmd User WikiLinkFollowed normal! zz
    augroup END

*<plug>(wiki-link-follow-split)*
*<plug>(wiki-link-follow-vsplit)*
*WikiLinkFollowSplit*
  Similar to |WikiLinkfollow|, except wiki links are followed in a |split|.
  The `vsplit` mapping uses a vertical split. Modifiers such as |:vertical|
  are allowed for the command, e.g. >vim

    :vert topleft WikiLinkfollowSplit

*<plug>(wiki-link-follow-tab)*
*WikiLinkFollowTab*
  Similar to |WikiLinkfollow|, except wiki links are followed in a |tabedit|.

*<plug>(wiki-link-return)*
*WikiLinkReturn*
  Go back to previous page, i.e. undo the last follow operation.

*<plug>(wiki-link-transform)*
*<plug>(wiki-link-transform-visual)*    |xmap|
*<plug>(wiki-link-transform-operator)*  |map-operator|
*WikiLinkTransform*
  Transform a link from one type to another based on the value of
  |g:wiki_link_transforms|.

  Additionally, this command and the mappings can be used to convert regular
  text to a link. The behaviour is controlled by |g:wiki_link_creation| and
  follows the following set of rules.

    If we are inside the journal: ~

  We would generally not want anything other than journal entries within the
  journal directory. Therefore we have some special rules here:

    - Check if any page exists inside the journal that matches the selected
      text/current word. If so, create link to that page.
    - Check if any page exists at the wiki root that matches the selected
      text/current word. If so, create link to that page.
    - Check if there are pages at the wiki root where the selected
      text/current word matches at the beginning. If so, let user choose which
      page to link to.
    - If neither of the above, then create a link to a page with name based on
      the selected text/current word at the wiki root.

    Everywhere else: ~

  The general idea is that links should be relative to the current directory.
  To make a link to a page at root, one may simply prepend a `/` to specify
  a "rooted" link. The conversion rules are therefore as follows:

    - Check if any page exists inside the current directory that matches the
      selected text/current word. If so, create link to that page.
    - Check if there are pages at the current directory where the selected
      text/current word matches at the beginning. If so, let user choose which
      page to link to.
    - If neither of the above, then create a link to a page with name based on
      the selected text/current word in current directory.

*<plug>(wiki-link-show)*
*WikiLinkShow*
  Show some info on link under cursor.

*<plug>(wiki-link-extract-header)*
*WikiLinkExtractHeader*
  Set link titles from the first header of the target file. In normal mode,
  this works on the link under the cursor. In visual mode, it works on all
  links in the current visual selection.

*<plug>(wiki-link-incoming-toggle)*
*WikiLinkIncomingToggle*
  NB: Neovim only!
  Toggle display of incoming links. When enabled, the buffer will be enriched
  with signs and virtual text to indicate any incoming links.

*<plug>(wiki-link-incoming-hover)*
*WikiLinkIncomingHover*
  When activated at a line to which there is an incoming link, this will show
  a menu that lists all incoming links to this line. If one of these are
  selected, you will navigate there.

*<plug>(wiki-page-delete)*
*WikiPageDelete*
  Delete wiki page.

*<plug>(wiki-page-rename)*
*WikiPageRename*
  Rename wiki page (will update all links to the page).

*<plug>(wiki-toc-generate)*
*WikiTocGenerate*
  Create/Update table of contents.

*<plug>(wiki-toc-generate-local)*
*WikiTocGenerateLocal*
  Create/Update table of contents (section local variant).

*<plug>(wiki-journal-index)*
*WikiJournalIndex*
  Insert a sorted list of links to all journal pages below the cursor. It uses
  the link type specified in |g:wiki_link_creation| for the current filetype.

*<plug>(wiki-journal-next)*
*WikiJournalNext*
  Go to the next journal entry (at current level of daily, weekly, monthly).

*<plug>(wiki-journal-prev)*
*WikiJournalPrev*
  Go to the previous journal entry (at current level of daily, weekly,
  monthly).

*<plug>(wiki-journal-copy-tonext)*
*WikiJournalCopyToNext*
  Copy current entry to the next (unless that entry already exists). Also
  opens the next entry.

*<plug>(wiki-journal-toweek)*
*WikiJournalToWeek*
  Go to week summary. If not existing, then parse the day entries to make
  a first draft. The title is given by |g:wiki_template_title_week|. For more
  info, see |wiki-templates-journal-summaries|.

*<plug>(wiki-journal-tomonth)*
*WikiJournalToMonth*
  Go to month summary. If not existing, then parse the day entries and
  relevant week summaries to make a first draft. The title is given by
  |g:wiki_template_title_month|. See also |wiki-templates-journal-summaries|.

*<plug>(wiki-export)*
*WikiExport*
`:[range]WikiExport [options] [fname]
  Export the current wiki file with `pandoc` (https://pandoc.org/). The main argument `fname`
  specifies the target filename and format (implied by the file extension),
  e.g. `test.pdf` or `test.html`. If `fname` is not specified, then the
  `-path` option is used to determine the output location. In this case, the
  `-view` option is activated regardless of the basic configuration.

  Available options are given below. The default values are specified in the
  dictionary |g:wiki_export|.

  -args ~
    Specify extra arguments for `pandoc`.

  -from-format FRMT | -f FRMT ~
    Specify format of the wiki page.

  -ext EXT ~
    Specify extension to use if `fname` is not provided.

  -link_ext_replace ~
    Set to true to replace in-wiki link extensions with html. This enables
    in-browser wiki navigation, but for it to work well, it requires that:

      1. `-ext` is set to `html`, and
      2. |g:wiki_link_creation| should have a `url_transform` that appends
         the extension.

  -output ~
    Set output directory where the exported file is stored. Relative paths are
    relative to the wiki root.

  -view ~
    Set to true to open documents with specified `viewer` by default.

  -viewer PATH ~
    Specify viewer to use to open the exported file. This implies `-view` and
    overrides the |g:wiki_viewer| option.

  Note: This feature requires `pandoc` (https://pandoc.org/) to build the
        output files.

*<plug>(wiki-tag-list)*
*WikiTagList*
  List all tags and the wiki pages that contain them.

  Available options are (use |g:wiki_tag_list| to set default values):

  -output TRG ~
    Where to put the search result. `TRG` may be one of:

      - `loclist`   Use |location-list|
      - `echo`      Display results on screen
      - `scratch`   Add results to a scratch buffer
      - `cursor`    Insert result below cursor


*<plug>(wiki-tag-reload)*
*WikiTagReload*
  Source wiki files and reload tags.

*<plug>(wiki-tag-search)*
*WikiTagSearch*  [options] [tag]
  List wiki pages that contain the desired `tag`. If the argument `tag` is not
  supplied, the command asks for input. See also |wiki-tags| for more
  information on the tags feature and |WikiTags| for an alternative search
  mechanism.

  Available options are (use |g:wiki_tag_search| to set default values):

  -output TRG ~
    Where to put the search result. `TRG` may be one of:

      - `loclist`   Use |location-list|
      - `echo`      Display results on screen
      - `scratch`   Add results to a scratch buffer
      - `cursor`    Insert result below cursor

*<plug>(wiki-tag-rename)*
*WikiTagRename*  [old_tag] [new_tag]
  Rename `old_tag` to `new_tag` in all pages. If zero or one arguments are
  supplied, the command asks for input. This command uses the `make` function
  of |g:wiki_tag_parsers|.

*<plug>(wiki-pages)*
*WikiPages*
  List wiki files in current wiki or in the main wiki defined by
  |g:wiki_root|. Select from list to open target page. This uses the UI select
  method defined by |g:wiki_select_method|.

    fzf specific behaviour ~
      If |g:wiki_select_method| is `'fzf'`, then it is possible to create
      a new page by pressing |g:wiki_fzf_pages_force_create_key| (alt-enter,
      by default). That is, a page whose name is equal to the fzf query will
      be created if it doesn't already exist. If the page exists, the existing
      page will be opened.

      For convenience, if the input query does not have any results, simply
      pressing enter will also create a page. E.g., if you searched for "My
      Fzf Page", and this term does not exist, then it will instead open a new
      page "My Fzf Page.wiki" (or similar, depending on the value of other
      options).

*<plug>(wiki-au)*
*<plug>(wiki-iu)*
  Text object for link URLs.

*<plug>(wiki-at)*
*<plug>(wiki-it)*
  Text object for link texts.

*<plug>(wiki-tags)*
*WikiTags*
  List tags from the current wiki. Allows to search for and navigate to
  a tag. This uses the UI select method defined by |g:wiki_select_method|.

*<plug>(wiki-toc)*
*WikiToc*
  Open a table of contents for the current wiki page with the UI select method
  specified by |g:wiki_select_method|.

COMPLETION                                                    *wiki-completion*

`wiki.vim` provides an |omni-complete| function to complete various link URLs
and tags. The feature is enabled by default; set |g:wiki_completion_enabled|
to 0 to disable it.

Link completion is available for:
- Markdown links with implied `wiki` scheme (|wiki-link-md|)
- Wiki links with implied `wiki` scheme (|wiki-link-wiki|)
- AsciiDoc links with implied `adoc` scheme (|wiki-link-adoc_xref_bracket|)
- Cite links with implied `zot` scheme (|wiki-link-cite|)

Tag completion completes tags where the tag parser's `re_findstart` value
matches the current line. See |g:wiki#tags#default_parser| for more info.

Related settings:
- |g:wiki_completion_enabled|
- |g:wiki_completion_case_sensitive|

==============================================================================
TAGS                                                                *wiki-tags*

Wiki pages may be tagged with keywords for organization. It is relatively easy
to define and specify custom tag parsers with |g:wiki_tag_parsers|. `wiki.vim`
ships a default parser that is automatically used, see |wiki-tags-default|.

The number of lines in which tags are recognized can be customized by modifying
the |g:wiki_tag_scan_num_lines| variable.

Related commands:
- |WikiTagList|
- |WikiTagReload|
- |WikiTagSearch|
- |WikiTagRename|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFAULT TAG PARSER                                          *wiki-tags-default*
                                                   *g:wiki#tags#default_parser*

The default tag parser adds support for tags within colons, i.e. `:tag-name:`.
Multiple tags may be specified both with `:tag1: :tag2:` and with the short
form `:tag1:tag2:`. The tag name must consist of purely non-space characters.

The full implementation is given in `autoload/wiki/tags.vim`, repeated here
for convenience: >vim

  let g:wiki#tags#default_parser = {
        \ 're_match': '\v%(^|\s):\zs[^: ]+\ze:',
        \ 're_findstart': '\v%(^|\s):\zs[^: ]+$'
        \}

  function! g:wiki#tags#default_parser.match(line) dict abort
    return a:line =~# self.re_match
  endfunction

  function! g:wiki#tags#default_parser.parse(line) dict abort
    let l:tags = []
    let l:tag = matchstr(a:line, self.re_match, 0)

    while !empty(l:tag)
      call add(l:tags, l:tag)
      let l:tag = matchstr(a:line, self.re_match, 0, len(l:tags) + 1)
    endwhile

    return l:tags
  endfunction

  function! g:wiki#tags#default_parser.make(taglist, curline='') dict abort
    return empty(a:taglist) ? '' : join(map(a:taglist, '":" . v:val . ":"'))
  endfunction

One may customize the default parser by adjusting `re_match`, `re_findstart`,
and `make`. E.g., to instead recognize hashed tags like `#tag1` and
`#my-other-tag`, one could add the following in one's vimrc: >vim

  let s:tag_parser = deepcopy(g:wiki#tags#default_parser)
  let s:tag_parser.re_match = '\v%(^|\s)#\zs[^# ]+'
  let s:tag_parser.re_findstart = '\v%(^|\s)#\zs[^# ]+'
  let s:tag_parser.make = {t, l -> empty(t) ? '' : join(map(t, '"#" . v:val'))}

  let g:wiki_tag_parsers = [s:tag_parser]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORGMODE TAG PARSER                                          *wiki-tags-orgmode*
                                                   *g:wiki#tags#orgmode_parser*

`wiki.vim` also ships a parser for Orgmode style tags, though it is not
activated my default. The main difference to the default parser is that
Orgmode style tags always use the short form `:tag1:tag2:`. They also only
ever appear at the end of headlines and the `#+FILETAGS:` property.

The full implementation is given in `autoload/wiki/tags.vim`. It is very
similar to |g:wiki#tags#default_parser|, so it is not repeated here.

To use the Orgmode tag parser, simply specify it in |g:wiki_tag_parsers|: >vim

  let g:wiki_tag_parsers = [g:wiki#tags#orgmode_parser]

==============================================================================
TEMPLATES                                                      *wiki-templates*

New pages are empty by default. However, it is possible to define templates
for prefilling new pages. Templates are specified with the option
|g:wiki_templates|, and if a template matches the new page it will be applied.
Only the first template that matches will be applied.

The templates can be specified as user functions or as template files. User
functions assume a single variable such as described in
|wiki-templates-context|. The template files should be formatted as described
in |wiki-templates-format|.

There is also a special kind of journal summary template. It is described in
detail in |wiki-templates-journal-summaries|.

Related settings:
- |g:wiki_templates|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEMPLATE FUNCTION CONTEXT                              *wiki-templates-context*

The functions in |g:wiki_templates| assume a single argument `context` which
is a dictionary with the following values:

  Key          Description                 Example ~
  ===          ===========                 =======
  `name`         Filename (no extension)     "New Page"
  `path`         Full path                   "/path/to/wiki/sub/New Page.md"
  `path_wiki`    Wiki path                   "/sub/New Page.md"
  `origin`       Origin position and link    `{...}`
  `date`         ISO date                    2021-07-01
  `time`         Time (24h format)           19:30

The `origin` value is a dictionary that represents the position before
following a link to create the page. It also includes the link object itself.
One may expect it to have one or more of the following keys:

  file ~
    Filename of file that contains the link.

  curpos ~
    Cursor position when the link was followed/activated.

  link ~
    A dictionary that contains the link object itself. This includes the link
    url and link text. The text part can be of interest if one wants to use it
    as the title of a document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEMPLATE FILE FORMAT                                    *wiki-templates-format*

A template file is essentially a simple text file to your liking. There are
two rules that allow dynamic templates:

  1. Variable substitution with `{variable}` strings. The allowed variables
     are the same as those available in |wiki-templates-context|. To access
     the contents of the `origin` dictionary, one may use dot notation, e.g.
     `{origin.origin}` and `{origin.pos_start}`.
  2. Function substitution with `{{Function Text String Here}}` strings. The
     context dictionary (|wiki-templates-context|) is always passed as the
     first argument. The text string, if it is not empty, is passed as
     a single string argument. The function is assumed to return either
     a string or a list of strings.

The first rule is applied first, which allows the arguments in Rule 2 to be
variable substitutions.

  Pre-defined functions                   Description ~
  =====================                   ===========
  `wiki#template#case_title(ctx, string)`   Returns `string` title cased

An example  ~
It may be hard to fully understand how all of the above works, so an example
is in order. Let's assume you keep a separate blog directory in your wiki,
then you could add a `.template.md` file with the following content to ensure
that you follow the same structure: >

  # {{wiki#template#case_title {name}}}
  Created: {date} {time}

  {{CustomUserFunc A new blog post}}

  # Introduction

  # Conclusion

Here `CustomUserFunc` must be defined, e.g. in your vimrc file. As explained,
the first argument is `ctx` - the context dictionary from
|wiki-templates-context|. The text "A new blog post" is passed as the
second argument as a string. The full content of the function is of course up
to the user, but it would look something like this: >vim

  function! CustomUserFunc(ctx, text) abort
    return a:ctx.name . ': ' . substitute(a:text, 'A new', 'An old', '')
  endfunction

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JOURNAL SUMMARIES                            *wiki-templates-journal-summaries*

`wiki.vim` supports parsing the journal entries in order to make weekly and
monthly summaries. A summary is automatically created when a summary file is
opened. One may also move from a daily entry to the corresponding week with
|WikiJournalToWeek|, and similarly to the corresponding month with
|WikiJournalToMonth|. Again, if these entries do not exist, they are
automatically created and journal entries are parsed to fill the contents.

The parsed results typically need manual editing, and it currently only works
for "list based" journals. That is, the summary generator works like this:
* First collect the text from entries to be summarized.
* Parse the text as topic lists (see example below).
* Combine the topic list entries in chronological order.
* Ignore all text after the first heading.

An example of a journal entry that will be parsed properly: >

  <tables on top are ignored>

  Topic 1
  * List based summary
  * With perhaps
    * sub lists

  Topic 2
  * List based summary
  * With perhaps
    * sub lists

  Topic 3
  * Link to [[#Specific note ...]]

  # Specific note (e.g. meeting note or similar)

  Everything from this section header and on will be ignored.

Note: There is no guarantee that this feature will work well if the journal

ADVANCED CONFIGURATION GUIDE                      *wiki-advanced-configuration*

`wiki.vim` provides options that allow users to customize how link URLs are
resolved and handled. The following are some examples of how to use these
options.

Notice that it is possibly to build upon the built-in functions. These
functions are not documented, but most of the useful functions should be
relatively self documented. They are found here:

- `autoload/wiki/url/resolvers.vim`
- `autoload/wiki/url/handlers.vim`
- `autoload/wiki/url/utils.vim`

Example 1: New scheme `test` ~
                                                       *wiki-advanced-config-1*
In this example, we add a new scheme `test` that should act like the `wiki`
scheme, except we want the handler to simply print the URL object. This way,
we could inspect the object provided to the handler function, which could be
useful to understand what you have to work with. In Vimscript, the example
looks like this: >vim

  function! MyTestHandler(resolved, ...) abort
    echo a:resolved
  endfunction

  let g:wiki_link_schemes = {
        \ 'test': {
        \   'resolver': function('wiki#url#resolvers#wiki'),
        \   'handler': function('MyTestHandler'),
        \ }
        \}

The same, but for Lua in neovim: >lua

  vim.g.wiki_link_schemes = {
    test = {
      resolver = vim.fn["wiki#url#resolvers#wiki"],
      handler = function(x) print(vim.inspect(x)) end,
    }
  }

Example 2: Adjust the `wiki` scheme to apply URL decoding ~
                                                       *wiki-advanced-config-2*
The standard `wiki` scheme does not perform any form of URL encoding or
decoding. If you want the link URLs to be encoded, but the actual file names
to be unencoded, then you could do something like this: >vim

  " This is basically the same as wiki#url#resolvers#wiki, except we added
  " a line to decode the encoded URL before we resolve the path.
  function! MyWikiResolver(url) abort
    let l:url = deepcopy(a:url)

    let l:url.anchor = wiki#url#utils#extract_anchor(l:url.stripped)

    let l:path = split(l:url.stripped, '#', 1)[0]
    let l:path = wiki#url#utils#url_decode(l:path)
    let l:url.path = wiki#url#utils#resolve_path(l:path, l:url.origin)

    return l:url
  endfunction

  " Change the wiki scheme resolver
  let g:wiki_link_schemes = {
        \ 'wiki': {
        \   'resolver': function('MyWikiResolver'),
        \ }
        \}

  " Only change the url_transform - will keep other parts at default settings
  let g:wiki_link_creation = {
        \ 'md': {
        \   'url_transform': { x -> wiki#url#utils#url_encode(x) },
        \ },
        \ 'wiki': {
        \   'url_transform': { x -> wiki#url#utils#url_encode(x) },
        \ },
        \}

Example 3: Customize the `wiki` select method ~
                                                       *wiki-advanced-config-3*
`wiki.vim` allows to customize the select method used for |WikiPage|, |WikiTags|
and |WikiToc|. Built-in choices include Telescope, |vim.ui.select| and
fzf.vim. But you can use watever fuzzy finder you want by creating the
selection functions yourself. The following is a setup using `fzf-lua`: >lua

  local fzf = require "fzf-lua"
  local fzf_data = require "fzf-lua".config.__resume_data

  local function fzf_pages()
    fzf.files({
      prompt = "Wiki files>",
      cwd = vim.g.wiki_root,
      actions = {
        ['default'] = function(selected)
          local note = selected[1]
          if not note then
            if fzf_data.last_query then
              note = fzf_data.last_query
            end
          end
          vim.fn["wiki#page#open"](note)
        end,
      }
    })
  end

  local function fzf_tags()
    local tags_with_locations = vim.fn["wiki#tags#get_all"]()
    local root = vim.fn["wiki#get_root"]()
    local items = {}
    for tag, locations in pairs(tags_with_locations) do
      for _, loc in pairs(locations) do
        local path = vim.fn["wiki#paths#relative"](loc[1], root)
        local str = string.format("%s:%d:%s", tag, loc[2], path)
        table.insert(items, str)
      end
    end
    fzf.fzf_exec(items, {
      actions = {
        ['default'] = function(selected)
          local note = vim.split(selected[1], ':')[3]
          if note then
            vim.fn["wiki#page#open"](note)
          end
        end
      }
    })
  end

  local function fzf_toc()
    local toc = vim.fn["wiki#toc#gather_entries"]()
    local items = {}
    for _, hd in pairs(toc) do
      local indent = vim.fn["repeat"](".", hd.level - 1)
      local line = indent .. hd.header
      table.insert(items, string.format("%d:%s", hd.lnum, line))
    end
    fzf.fzf_exec(items, {
      actions = {
        ['default'] = function(selected)
          local ln = vim.split(selected[1], ':')[1]
          if ln then
            vim.fn.execute(ln)
          end
        end
      }
    })
  end

  vim.g.wiki_select_method = {
    pages = fzf_pages,
    tags = fzf_tags,
    toc = fzf_toc,
  }
