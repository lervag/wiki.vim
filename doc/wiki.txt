INTRODUCTION                                                       *wiki-intro*

This is a Vim plugin for writing and maintaining a personal wiki. The plugin
was initially based on vimwiki (https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), but it is
written mostly from scratch and is based on a more "do one thing and do it
well" philosophy.

The plugin will activate by default for `.wiki` files, but this may be
customized with |g:wiki_filetypes|. One may also explicitly activate with
|WikiEnable|. The wiki root is automatically detected as long as there is
a top-level `index.wiki` file available. If no such file is found, it sets the
root to the same directory as the current file. In addition, one may specify
a main wiki with the |g:wiki_root| option. This allows convenient mappings and
commands for opening the main wiki from anywhere.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS                                          *wiki-intro-requirements*

This plugin is mainly developed on and for Linux. Some or most of the features
should still work on Windows and OSX, but currently there are no guaranties.

The following is a list of external tools that are used for some of the
features:

  | Program                      | Feature                        |
  | ---------------------------- + ------------------------------ |
  | `date`                         | for journal related stuff      |
  | `xdg-open`                     | for opening `pdf` files on Linux |
  | `pandoc` (https://pandoc.org/) | for |WikiPrint|                  |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE                                                        *wiki-intro-usage*

This outlines the basic steps to get started:

1. Create a wiki directory where the wiki files should be stored, for instance
   `~/documents/wiki`.

2. Add the following to your `vimrc` file: >

   let g:wiki_root = '~/documents/wiki'

3. Now you can open the index file (that is, `index.wiki`) with `<leader>ww`
   and start to add your notes as desired.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                     *wiki-config*

*g:wiki_root*
  The root path for the main wiki, i.e. the wiki that is opened with the
  `<leader>ww` mapping.

  Default: ''

*g:wiki_filetypes*
  List of filetypes for which |wiki.vim| should be enabled.

  Default: ['wiki']

*g:wiki_link_extension*
  Specify extension that should be applied to wiki links.

  Default: ''

*g:wiki_link_target_map*
  This option may be used to transform text before creating a new link. An
  example: >

    let g:wiki_link_target_map = 'MyFunction'

    function MyFunction(text) abort
      return substitute(tolower(a:text), '\s\+', '-', 'g')
    endfunction
<
  With the above setting, links created with |WikiLinkOpen| or
  |WikiLinkToggle| (or related mappings) will be transformed by `MyFunction`.
  As an example, if one creates a link from the text "Some text", the link
  becomes "[[some-text|Some text]]".

  Default: ''

*g:wiki_journal*
  The name of the diary or journal sub folder.

  Default: `'journal'`

*g:wiki_mappings_use_defaults*
  Whether or not to use default mappings (see |wiki-mappings-default|). If
  this is set to 0, then only custom mappings will be applied. Custom mappings
  may either be specified explicitly or through |g:wiki_mappings_global| and
  |g:wiki_mappings_local|.

  Default: 1

*g:wiki_mappings_global*
*g:wiki_mappings_local*
  These options allow one to customize global and buffer local mappings
  through dictionaries where the keys are the right-hand sides and the values
  are the desired mappings, e.g.: >

    let g:wiki_mappings_global = {
        \ '<plug>(wiki-reload)' : ',wx',
        \}
<
  This example will keep the default maps (unless disabled), except for
  `<plug>(wiki-reload)`, which will be mapped to `,wx`. The available `<plug>`
  mappings are listed in |wiki-mappings|.

  Default: Undefined

*g:wiki_month_names*
  A list of the names for each month. Used for interpolating month names in
  the month template, |g:wiki_template_title_month|.

  Default: `['January', 'February', ..., 'December']`

*g:wiki_list_todos*
  A list of TODO toggles that may be toggled with |<plug>(wiki-list-toggle)|,
  which is by default mapped to `<c-s>`.

  Default: `['TODO', 'DONE']`

*g:wiki_toc_title*
  The title of TOC listings.

  Default: `'Contents'`

*g:wiki_file_open*
  Name of a function or a |FuncRef| for a function that should be used to open
  a file url (see also |wiki-links-urls|). The function should give a non-zero
  return value if it opens the url. If not, the plugin falls back to opening
  the url with Vim. An example: >

    let g:wiki_file_open = 'WikiFileOpen'

    function! WikiFileOpen(...) abort dict
      if self.path =~# 'pdf$'
        silent execute '!zathura' fnameescape(self.path) '&'
        return 1
      endif

      return 0
    endfunction

*g:wiki_generic_viewer*
  A string that specifies the generic viewer that is used by the generic link
  scheme opener (see |wiki-links-urls|).

  Default: (OS dependent)
    Linux   `xdg-open`
    OSX     `open`

*g:wiki_pdf_viewer*
  A string that specifies the `pdf` viewer that is used by |WikiPrint|.

  Default: (OS dependent)
    Linux   `xdg-open`
    OSX     `open`

*g:wiki_template_title_month*
  A string that specifies the title of the month template. The following keys
  are interpolated:

    `%(month)`         Month number
    `%(month-name)`    Name of month (see |g:wiki_month_names|)
    `%(year)`          Year (4 digits)

  Default: `'# Summary, %(year) %(month-name)'`

*g:wiki_template_title_week*
  A string that specifies the title of the week template. The following keys
  are interpolated:

    `%(week)`    Week number
    `%(year)`    Year (4 digits)

  Default: `'# Summary, %(year) week %(week)'`

==============================================================================

==============================================================================
LINKS                                                              *wiki-links*

Links are one of the most essential features of a wiki, and as such, requires
particular attention.  A link is a structure that consists of an URL (see
|wiki-links-urls|) and a possibly empty description.  Links are highlighted as
described in |wiki-syntax-links|.  Any link may be activated with the mapping
`<cr>` or `<c-cr>`, where the latter will open the link in a split (if it is
an internal link).  One may use `<bs>` to navigate back after following
a link.

These are the link formats that are currently supported:

- Link URLs                          |wiki-links-urls|
    `http://www.example.com`
    `wiki:index`
    `journal:2013-04-05`
    `doi:10.1002%2Fandp.19053220607`
- Markdown links                     |wiki-links-markdown|
    `[Description](Link)`
- Wiki links                         |wiki-links-wiki|
    `[[Link]]`
    `[[Link|Description]]`
- Reference links                    |wiki-links-reference|
    `[Target]`
    `[Description][Target]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINK URLS                                                     *wiki-links-urls*

An URL, which is short for Uniform Resource Locator, has the general format

  `[scheme:]address`

The `scheme` specifies which kind of link it is.  If no handle is specified,
it is assumed that the address is an internal wiki link, i.e. the `wiki` scheme
is assumed.

The following schemes are supported:

  wiki~
  journal~
    Links to an internal wiki page.  The address can be both relative and
    absolute.  Absolute addresses are relative to the wiki root.  Further, the
    addresses may include anchors to specific sections of the wiki entry.
    Some examples might be enlightening: >

      wiki:index

      If the address has whitespace, we need to use a full link style, for
      instance:

      [[wiki:index#section 1]]

      Also, to link to a journal entry, one may use:
      journal:2014-03-02

      For convenience, an ISO date will also work as a journal link.
<
  file~
    Links to a file on the system and opens it.  This can be customized with
    |g:wiki_file_open|, but falls back to opening the file with Vim.

  doi~
    Will use the `generic` scheme handler on an expanded URL of the form
    `http://dx.doi.org/<address>`, where `<address>` is the link address.

  generic~
    If the scheme is not recognized, the link is opened with the system
    handler, which is defined by |g:wiki_pdf_viewer| on Linux.  Currently,
    only Linux is supported here.  This will work quite well on standard Linux
    distributions, e.g. for opening `http` and `https` URLs.

Schemes are defined in `autoload/wiki/url/{scheme}.vim`, which means it is
relatively easy to define new custom schemes. See the generic scheme for
a simple example of how this is implemented.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARKDOWN LINKS                                            *wiki-links-markdown*

Markdown links are one of the standard type of links, and the look like this: >

  [Description](url)

One may toggle between markdown style links and wiki style links with the
`<leader>wf` mapping.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WIKI LINKS                                                    *wiki-links-wiki*

Wiki links are similar in style to the standard Mediawiki links.  This is the
main syntax for creating internal wiki links.  The description part is
optional.  Examples: >

    [[Link]]
    [[Link|Description]]

Any non-link words may be turned into a wiki link with the `<cr>` mapping.
One may also use visual mode to turn a selection into a wiki link, or one may
use the `gl` operator.

The `<leader>wf` mapping can be used to add a description to a wiki link or to

REFERENCE LINKS                                          *wiki-links-reference*

Reference style links are slightly different.  They consist of up to three
parts: An optional `description`, a `target` and a `link.`  The syntax is best
explained through an example: >

  The most simple form, and perhaps the most useful one, is to add a simple
  reference like this [1].

  One may also add a [description][target].

  The target may consist of both words and numbers, e.g. [like this][Ref 3].
  [Description][Target]

  [1]: Link 1
  [Target]: Link 2
  [Ref 3]: Link 3

Reference style links may be opened with `<cr>` both on the reference location
and on the link line.

LISTS                                                              *wiki-lists*

It is common to write lists inside wikis, and so there is some support for
working with lists:

- Use `<c-s>` in both insert and normal mode to toggle a TODO at the beginning
  of the list item, or to toggle the checkbox if it is present.

COMPLETION                                                    *wiki-completion*

This plugin provides an |omni-complete| function that completes internal link
targets, including anchors.  This should work both for markdown and wiki
style links (see |wiki-links|).
